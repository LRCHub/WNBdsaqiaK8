When I lost my way
You were my light
When others wronged me
You did me right
When I look in your eyes
Don't tell me lies
You tell me the truth
Your words, they get me through

This is all I've got
This is all I say
If this were my last day

This is my last song
It's all I got
If I bear my soul
Don't you break my heart
Won't you sing along
This is my last song
It's all I got
So don't you break my heart

Wrote down these words
Put 'em in this song
I play it for you
Pray they don't come out wrong
'Cause all I got's my word
I give it to you
Now it may not be much
It's the best that I can do

This is all I got
This is all I say
So please don't walk away
This is my last song
It's all I got
If I bear my soul
Don't you break my heart
Won't you sing along
This is my last song
It's all I got
So don't you break my heart

Solo

If this were my last breath
Or my last day
My last chance
This is what I'd say
I thank you for the laughter
Sorry for the tears
Time to say goodbye
I say goodbye
After all these years

This is my last song
It's all I got
If I bear my soul
Don't you break my heart
Won't you sing along
This is my last song
It's all I got
So don't you break my heart

This is my last song
It's all I got
If I bear my soul
Don't you break my heart
Won't you sing along
This is my last song
It's all I got
You shouldn't of broke my heart
