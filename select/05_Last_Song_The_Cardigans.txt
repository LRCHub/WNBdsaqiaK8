The night she died in the rented room
As the whole town was sleeping
She held her breath like a star in bloom
Could burn down tomorrow

The summer breeze was caressing me
As I walked through the market
The golden light of a friend beside
Had died out for good

Now nothing can amaze me
As everything's behind me
No, nothing else can please me
Since all I had has been set free

The night before in the dining room
I recall it now
She said "I fear for you my friend
Cause I'll soon be leaving"

The autumn comes just like other years
But I won't see the signs
The sun above's sowing magic seeds
But it wants someone back
