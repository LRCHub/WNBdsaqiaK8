Born on a tear,
That seeps from the dagger shaped hole in your heart.
Wounds that run deep.
Well I'll try to patch them as best as I can.

If the sun melts the black of the street,
And the long road home sticks to your feet.
When the music that frees you has all but been used up,
Then I'll sing the last song for you.

I hate to see your heart breaking.
I'll hold it safe in my hands.
I don't know if my words can bind it together,
But that's all I know how to do.
So I'll sing the last song for you.

I ain't got much.
That I can give you, to keep you afloat.
Mumbled comforts,
Are no use for wrestling demons, I know.
But a lopsided smile and a lovesick recital,
Might loosen the burden for now.

The penultimate beat of the drum,
As the second to last chord is strummed.
When all other words have already been heard,
I'll sing the last song for you.
I'll sing the last song for you.
I'll sing the last song for you.
I'll sing the last song for you.
