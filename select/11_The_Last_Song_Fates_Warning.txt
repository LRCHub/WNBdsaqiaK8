These memories
Come falling down like leaves
We were just fools pretending
The world was at our knees
Headlong into the summer sun
But now our winter has begun

The days ahead
Just questions in the mist
While we wonder
How we ever ended up like this
Hope and fear, of thee I sing
What will tomorrow bring?

It's hard to understand where the time went
Looking back upon the years, I never dreamt
That fate would show its hand and a life spent
Walking down the only road I've ever known

The curtain falls
Upon a darkened stage
Voices fade like words across
Some worn out ending page
The writer writes his final wrong
This is the last song
